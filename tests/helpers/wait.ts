/**
 * Wait helper utilities for Playwright tests.
 *
 * Note: Most wait operations are unnecessary since:
 * - Database operations are synchronous (SQLite)
 * - Playwright's auto-waiting handles most UI scenarios
 *
 * Only add helpers here when there's a clear, recurring need.
 */

// Currently empty - add helpers only when actually needed in tests
