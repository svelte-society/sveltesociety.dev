# PRD: Playwright E2E Testing Implementation

**Author:** Engineering Team
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Draft
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements and implementation strategy for introducing comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing using Playwright in the Svelte Society content management platform. While Playwright is already installed and a basic test exists, we need a robust, scalable E2E testing framework that covers critical user journeys, authentication flows, and content management workflows.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure

**✅ What We Have:**
- Playwright installed (`@playwright/test@^1.56.0`)
- Basic configuration in `playwright.config.ts`
- One minimal test (`tests/test.ts`) checking homepage loads
- Comprehensive unit test coverage for services (15 service test files)
- Vitest for unit testing with in-memory database mocking
- Service layer architecture with clear separation of concerns

**❌ Current Gaps:**
- No database initialization scripts for E2E tests (references to `db:test:init` and `db:test:seed` in package.json don't exist)
- No authentication fixtures or helpers
- No test data management strategy
- No Page Object Models (POMs)
- No coverage of critical user flows
- No CI/CD integration for E2E tests
- No test isolation or parallel execution strategy
- No environment-specific configuration

### Application Architecture Context

**Route Structure:**
- Public routes: Home, Events, Content browsing (`[...type]`, `[type]/[slug]`), User profiles, Submit, Saved
- Authentication: Login, OAuth callback
- Admin routes: Content management, Moderation queue, User/Role management, Tags, Bulk import, Announcements

**Key Features to Test:**
- **Content Types:** `recipe`, `video`, `library`, `announcement`, `link`, `blog`, `collection`, `event`
- **Content Status Workflow:** `draft` → `pending_review` → `published` → `archived`
- **Authentication:** GitHub OAuth, session management, role-based permissions
- **Search:** Orama-powered full-text search
- **External Content:** YouTube video imports, GitHub repository imports
- **Interactions:** Saves/bookmarks, content filtering, pagination
- **Admin Features:** Content moderation, role management, bulk operations

---

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

1. **Confidence in Deployments:** Catch regressions before production
2. **Critical Path Coverage:** Test all user-critical workflows end-to-end
3. **Authentication Testing:** Verify auth flows and role-based access
4. **Cross-browser Validation:** Ensure consistent behavior across browsers
5. **CI/CD Integration:** Automated test execution on every PR

### Success Metrics

- ✅ 80%+ coverage of critical user journeys within 3 months
- ✅ E2E tests run in <10 minutes in CI
- ✅ <5% flaky test rate
- ✅ Zero production incidents related to untested flows after 6 months
- ✅ All new features ship with corresponding E2E tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risks

**R1: Database State Management**
- **Risk:** Tests interfere with each other, causing flakiness
- **Mitigation:**
  - Run tests sequentially (workers: 1)
  - Clear database between test files
  - Use transactions where possible for isolation

**R2: External API Dependencies**
- **Risk:** YouTube/GitHub API calls make tests slow and unreliable
- **Mitigation:**
  - Mock external APIs using Playwright's route interception
  - Use fixtures with pre-recorded responses
  - Test external integrations separately with dedicated mocks

**R3: OAuth Flow Complexity**
- **Risk:** Difficult to test GitHub OAuth without real credentials
- **Mitigation:**
  - Create API-based authentication shortcut for tests
  - Use storage state to bypass OAuth in most tests
  - Mock OAuth provider responses

### Medium Risks

**R4: Test Maintenance Burden**
- **Risk:** Tests become outdated as features evolve
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use POMs to centralize page interactions
  - Write tests alongside feature development
  - Regular test review and refactoring

**R5: CI/CD Performance**
- **Risk:** Tests take too long, slowing down development
- **Mitigation:**
  - Optimize test suite structure
  - Run smoke tests first (fail fast)
  - Parallelize where safe
  - Cache build artifacts

### Low Risks

**R6: Browser Compatibility**
- **Risk:** Tests pass on Chromium but fail on Firefox/WebKit
- **Mitigation:**
  - Start with Chromium only
  - Add Firefox/WebKit in Phase 4
  - Use Playwright's cross-browser abstractions

---

## Success Criteria & Acceptance

### Phase 1 Acceptance (Foundation)
- [ ] Test database initializes correctly
- [ ] Authentication fixtures create users and sessions
- [ ] Playwright config supports local and CI environments
- [ ] 5+ smoke tests pass consistently
- [ ] Tests run in CI pipeline

### Phase 2 Acceptance (Core Journeys)
- [ ] All public user flows tested (browse, search, view)
- [ ] Content submission tested for all types
- [ ] 20+ tests passing with <5% flakiness
- [ ] POMs established for major pages

### Phase 3 Acceptance (Admin Workflows)
- [ ] Admin authentication and authorization tested
- [ ] Content moderation fully covered
- [ ] User/role management tested
- [ ] 40+ total tests passing

### Phase 4 Acceptance (Production Ready)
- [ ] Full suite runs in <10 minutes
- [ ] <5% flaky test rate
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] 80%+ coverage of critical journeys
- [ ] Team trained and comfortable writing tests

## Open Questions

1. **Q:** Should we run E2E tests on every commit or only on PRs?
   - **A:** Start with PR-only to optimize CI time, then evaluate after Phase 4

2. **Q:** How do we handle visual regression testing?
   - **A:** Out of scope for initial implementation; consider Percy or Playwright screenshots in future

3. **Q:** Should we test mobile responsive behavior?
   - **A:** Priority 3 (P2); add viewport configurations in Phase 4 if time permits

4. **Q:** How do we test email notifications or background jobs?
   - **A:** Out of scope for E2E; consider separate integration tests or manual verification

5. **Q:** What's our strategy for testing in production-like environments?
   - **A:** Phase 4 should include staging environment testing with real data (read-only)

## Appendix

### Example Test Structure

```typescript
// tests/e2e/content/submit-recipe.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'
import { SubmitPage } from '../../pages/SubmitPage'
import { authenticatedUser } from '../../fixtures/auth.fixture'

test.describe('Submit Recipe Flow', () => {
  test.use(authenticatedUser)

  test('should successfully submit a new recipe', async ({ page }) => {
    const submitPage = new SubmitPage(page)
    await submitPage.goto()

    await submitPage.selectContentType('recipe')
    await submitPage.fillRecipeForm({
      title: 'Test Recipe',
      description: 'A test recipe description',
      body: 'Recipe content here...',
      tags: ['svelte', 'testing']
    })

    await submitPage.submit()
    await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/submit\/thankyou/)
    await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Thank you')
  })

  test('should validate required fields', async ({ page }) => {
    const submitPage = new SubmitPage(page)
    await submitPage.goto()

    await submitPage.selectContentType('recipe')
    await submitPage.submit()

    await expect(submitPage.titleError).toBeVisible()
    await expect(submitPage.descriptionError).toBeVisible()
  })
})
```
