# SEO Audit Summary - Pre-Launch Assessment

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** 🚨 Critical Items Required Before Launch
**Current SEO Score:** ~60/100 (Estimated)
**Target SEO Score:** 95+/100

## Executive Summary

Svelte Society has a solid foundation for SEO (clean URLs, SSR, structured content), but **critical SEO infrastructure is missing** that will severely impact search visibility and social sharing after launch.

### 🚨 Launch Blockers (Must Fix)

1. **No robots.txt** → Search engines have no crawling guidance
2. **No sitemap.xml** → No URL discovery mechanism
3. **No Open Graph tags** → Poor Facebook/LinkedIn sharing
4. **No Twitter Cards** → No Twitter preview cards
5. **No og:image** → Social shares lack visual appeal
6. **No Schema.org data** → Missing rich search results
7. **No canonical URLs** → Duplicate content risk

### ✅ What's Working Well

1. Clean URL structure (`/recipe/slug`, `/video/slug`)
2. SSR-enabled SvelteKit architecture
3. Svead library installed (just underutilized)
4. Basic meta tags (title, description)
5. Image optimization infrastructure ready (wsrv.nl)
6. Analytics integrated (Umami)

## Critical Gaps Detail

### Search Engine Indexing
**Current State:** ❌ Broken
- No robots.txt = search engines don't know what to crawl
- No sitemap.xml = search engines can't discover content
- **Impact:** Site won't be properly indexed, content won't appear in search results

**Fix Required:**
- Dynamic robots.txt endpoint
- Dynamic sitemap.xml with all published content
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console

---

### Social Media Sharing
**Current State:** ❌ Poor Experience
- No Open Graph tags = generic/broken social previews
- No Twitter Cards = no rich Twitter previews
- No og:image = shares have no visual
- **Impact:** Users won't share content, poor viral growth

**Example Current Behavior:**
When someone shares a recipe on Facebook:
- Title: Generic browser title
- Description: None or first text on page
- Image: None (Facebook picks random image or nothing)
- Result: Looks unprofessional, low click-through

**Fix Required:**
- Full OG tag implementation
- Twitter Card meta tags
- Dynamic OG image generation (1200x630px)
- Branded social preview template

---

### Rich Search Results
**Current State:** ❌ Missing Opportunity
- No Schema.org JSON-LD = no rich snippets
- **Impact:** Content appears as plain text in search results, lower CTR

**Example Missed Opportunities:**
- Recipe pages could show rating stars, author, date
- Video pages could show thumbnails, duration in search results
- Library pages could show GitHub stars, description
- Events could show date/time/location

**Fix Required:**
- Organization schema (homepage)
- WebSite schema with SearchAction
- VideoObject schema (videos)
- TechArticle schema (recipes)
- SoftwareSourceCode schema (libraries)
- BreadcrumbList schema (all pages)

## Quick Wins vs. Deep Work

### Quick Wins (Day 1-2)
- ✅ Add robots.txt (2 hours)
- ✅ Add sitemap.xml (4 hours)
- ✅ Extend Svead config with OG tags (4 hours)
- ✅ Add canonical URLs (2 hours)
- ✅ Add resource hints (1 hour)

### Deep Work (Day 3-5)
- 🔧 OG image generation (8 hours)
- 🔧 Schema.org implementation (10 hours)
- 🔧 Testing & validation (6 hours)

## Implementation Priority

### P0 - Do Before Launch (3-5 days)
1. robots.txt + sitemap.xml
2. Open Graph tags (all pages)
3. Twitter Cards
4. OG image generation
5. Canonical URLs
6. Schema.org (basic)
7. Standardize all pages to use Svead

### P1 - Launch Week (2-3 days)
1. Image lazy loading
2. Resource hints
3. Complete Schema.org coverage
4. E2E tests for SEO
5. Manual validation across tools

### P2 - Post-Launch (Ongoing)
1. Static page prerendering
2. RSS feed
3. Advanced schema types
4. Performance optimizations

## Estimated Effort

**Total Time:** 5-7 days (1 developer)
- Day 1: Foundation (robots, sitemap, resource hints)
- Day 2: Meta tags (OG, Twitter, canonical)
- Day 3: OG images
- Day 4: Schema.org
- Day 5: Testing & polish
- Day 6-7: Buffer for issues

**Can be parallelized:**
- robots.txt + sitemap (1 person)
- OG tags + Twitter cards (1 person)
- Schema.org (1 person)

## Testing Checklist

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
**Launching without SEO fixes:**
- Content won't be indexed properly → Low organic traffic
- Social shares look broken → Low viral growth
- Missing rich results → Lower click-through rate
- **Business Impact:** Acquisition will rely 100% on paid/direct traffic

### Medium Risk
**OG image generation complexity:**
- Mitigation: Use simple template, fallback to static image
- Alternative: Pre-generate on publish

### Low Risk
**Svead library limitations:**
- Mitigation: Library is actively maintained, fallback to manual meta tags

## Success Metrics (30 Days Post-Launch)

### Technical
- Lighthouse SEO score: 95+
- Google Search Console: 0 critical errors
- Pages indexed: 90%+ of published content
- Schema errors: 0

### Business
- Organic search traffic: >20% of total
- Social referral traffic: >10% of total
- Avg. time on page from social: >2min
- Bounce rate from social: <60%

## Competitive Analysis

Checked similar sites:
- **Svelte.dev** - ✅ Has OG tags, Schema.org, sitemap
- **Vue.js.org** - ✅ Has OG tags, Schema.org, sitemap
- **React.dev** - ✅ Has OG tags, Schema.org, sitemap

**Our current state:** Below industry standard for developer community sites.

## Recommendation

**Do not launch without P0 items complete.**

The effort required (3-5 days) is minimal compared to the cost of launching without proper SEO. Once live, it takes 2-4 weeks for Google to index changes, meaning any SEO fixes post-launch will take a month to show impact.

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Implement P0 items (days 1-5)
2. Launch with validated SEO
3. Continue P1 items during launch week
4. Monitor Search Console daily for first 2 weeks
5. Iterate on P2 items based on data

## Next Steps

1. **Review PRD:** `docs/PRD_SEO_META_TAGS.md` (full implementation details)
2. **Assign Resources:** Allocate developer(s) for 5-7 days
3. **Set Deadline:** Complete P0 before launch date
4. **Create Tasks:** Break down PRD into tickets
5. **Schedule Testing:** Reserve 1 day for validation before launch
